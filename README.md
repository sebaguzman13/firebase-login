# React (Typescript) + Frebase Authentication

This is a Login/Register Project with [React](https://en.reactjs.org/) + [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to handle Authentication.

For the Firebase conextion to work you'll have to have to create a `.env` file on the root directory and add your Firebase Credentials following [React](https://en.reactjs.org/)'s syntax for enabling the auto discover by react-scripts, or you can wrote your credentials directly to the `./services/firebaseApp.ts` file.

#### But remember not to commit your private credentials to public repositories.
